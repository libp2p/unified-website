Today, the libp2p project is excited to announce the **first ever** libp2p retroactive public goods funding round, libp2p-rPGF-1!

The libp2p project is partnering with Gitcoin to retroactively award $125,000 USD worth of OP, recognize impact, and further empower contributors to libp2p.

libp2p will be using a portion of its Optimism rPGF round 3 rewards to contribute back to the broader ecosystem!

libp2p is a public good which powers much of the decentralized web, including projects like Ethereum, Filecoin, Optimism, Polkadot, and more! Moreover, libp2p's success as a project is the result of a vast panoply of communities, collaborators, and organizations building together.

However, these efforts are often unrecognized and unrewarded since markets can fail to adequately fund public goods. By embracing RetroPGF, libp2p seeks to bridge that funding gap.

## The Process

The rounds follow the Optimism template:

1. Badgeholders selection
2. Nominations/Application submissions
3. Voting by badgeholders
4. Publish voting results
5. Distribute rewards/funding
6. Retrospective to improve future rounds

## Categories

Anyone can nominate a project that has achieved impact in the past 12 months in one of the following categories:

- Software & Dependencies
- Infrastructure, Tooling, & Utilities
- Education, Outreach, and Applications
- Research & Development
- Other

This round aims to disburse $125,000 USD worth of OP, with plans to grow in the future.

We would like to thank the participants & sponsors for pushing the ecosystem forward and helping bootstrap public goods funding into the libp2p project!
