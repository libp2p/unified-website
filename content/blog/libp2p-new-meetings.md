The libp2p Community is growing a little bit every day since the creation of the libp2p Foundation and the independence of the libp2p Project back in January of 2024.

One such improvement was the centralization of the libp2p Community Calendar to one location: [lu.ma/libp2p](https://lu.ma/libp2p).

This blog post covers all of the current community meetings you will find on the calendar as well as outline how you can organize your own and get it promoted alongside the other libp2p meetings.

## The Current Calendar

Check out the [libp2p community calendar](https://lu.ma/libp2p) and add it to your calendar to stay up to date with all the meetings.

## Starting a New Meeting

The libp2p Community operates on a "2 + you" rule for meetings. If you and two other people would like to start a meeting, let me know and I will help you organize it, list it on the libp2p calendar, announce it on our social media feeds and all of our chat channels.

Find me (@dhuseby) on any of our [chat rooms](https://libp2p.io) and let me know so I can help get it organized.
