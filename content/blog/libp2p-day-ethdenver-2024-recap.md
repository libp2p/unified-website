Last month on February 29th, 2024, the libp2p community came together in Denver, Colorado to hold the first libp2p Day in 2024 alongside the ETHDenver conference.

### SWOT Analysis

At the end of the day we had our first "Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats" (SWOT) session of 2024. The highlights:

**Strengths**
- Our community has expanded to include at least 5 implementations used in production
- Several independent communities based around the different implementations
- There is some funding to sustain the project going forward

**Weaknesses**
- Learning libp2p is still somewhat difficult

**Opportunities**
- Focus funding on creation of new learning materials
- Make libp2p into the go-to library for distributed systems researchers
- Focus on mobile optimization

**Threats**
- Continued funding is always going to be a threat to the health of the community

## Talks

We had a great event with 12 different sessions focusing on topics such as public goods funding, probing p2p networks, synchronization protocols in blockchains, designing peer-to-peer social networks and others.
