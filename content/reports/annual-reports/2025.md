## Executive Summary

### **Network Performance, Protocol Reliability, and the Foundation of Decentralized AI**

For nearly a decade, libp2p has defined secure, modular, and high-performance peer-to-peer networking, now powering more than 30 major blockchain networks, content distribution systems, IoT deployments, and emerging autonomous compute fabrics. Collectively, these systems secure and move over $100B in value across the open internet. Since the launch of the libp2p Core Fund, the project has entered a new phase of maturity — evolving from a widely adopted networking library into foundational infrastructure for internet-scale, decentralized systems.

Today, libp2p underpins critical production environments including Ethereum light clients, rollup sequencers, and data availability networks such as Celestia, Avail, and EigenDA. Its lightweight, modular design increasingly powers browsers, mobile devices, IoT hardware, and embedded systems, environments where resilience, energy efficiency, and low-latency communication are non-negotiable. This breadth reflects libp2p’s core strength: enabling secure, resilient connectivity across heterogeneous, adversarial, and resource-constrained networks.

This momentum is sustained by a uniquely durable ecosystem: over 10 active implementations maintained across more than a dozen organizations, and a contributor base exceeding 300 active developers per month. Recent advances across QUIC, GossipSub, and WebTransport have materially improved throughput, reliability, and interoperability, enabling wallet-as-a-node architectures, ultra-light RPC networks, and real-time state retrieval for Ethereum’s Portal Network. Interoperability is no longer aspirational; it is becoming a product guarantee.

Looking ahead to 2026, libp2p is consolidating its role as the communication fabric for decentralized AI and autonomous systems. Its trust-minimized messaging layer enables agents to discover one another, negotiate, coordinate, and exchange value without centralized intermediaries supporting agent economies, on-device intelligence, and distributed compute networks. These same properties make libp2p critical for IoT and embedded AI, where secure, private, and resilient peer-to-peer communication must function under unreliable network conditions and constrained hardware.

Across all of this work, privacy-preserving communication and an open, modular, multi-implementation architecture are foundational design constraints, not optional features. This approach benefits the entire Web3 ecosystem by enabling secure, neutral, and interoperable networking primitives that any blockchain can adopt without lock-in.

As more Web3 projects build on libp2p, these guarantees help strengthen cross-chain interoperability, developer trust, and long-term resilience across the broader decentralized ecosystem. Reducing metadata leakage, supporting confidential networking, and maintaining neutral, shared ownership across ecosystems are essential to libp2p’s long-term relevance and trust.

At the frontier, libp2p continues to explore high-upside domains through applied research and proof-of-concept deployments,  including next-generation P2P primitives for financial coordination, real-time cross-chain communication, and post-quantum interoperability. These efforts ensure that as decentralized finance, modular blockchains, and autonomous systems evolve, the underlying network fabric remains robust, future-proof, and interoperable by default.

Together, these advances position libp2p as the essential network fabric for the next decade of decentralized compute, agent coordination, embedded intelligence, and resilient internet infrastructure, enabling a more open, autonomous, and durable digital world.

## ROAD MAP 2026

### Direction & Scope

Looking ahead to 2026, the libp2p roadmap is anchored in strengthening privacy-first, confidential networking as a default property of peer-to-peer systems, while deliberately investing in a set of high-upside areas that will shape the next generation of decentralized infrastructure. This includes early work on next-generation P2P primitives for financial coordination and RWA-enabled DeFi, cross-chain communication patterns spanning chains, rollups, and modular stacks, and a more modular developer ecosystem with tooling and extensions that lower the barrier to building and operating P2P applications across environments.

These directions represent areas of active exploration and continued investment. Over the coming weeks, we’ll be working closely with Web3 and AI leaders to pressure-test these themes, refine priorities, and shape how they move from concept to implementation. More concrete milestones and initiatives will follow. Watch this space.

## 2025 achievements

### **libp2p as a Networking Layer for Ethereum Light Clients**

The Portal Network adopted libp2p transports \+ gossip for ultra-light Ethereum RPC and state retrieval, enabling true mobile and home-run light clients.

### **libp2p GossipSub Increasingly Adopted in Multiple L2 Rollup Sequencer Networks**

libp2p GossipSub is becoming the preferred coordination layer for emerging decentralized sequencer networks and shared sequencing architectures (Espresso, Astria, Radius). OP Stack ecosystems are evaluating and integrating compatible meshes.

### **Strengthened QUIC \+ WebTransport availability**

QUIC maturation that enables lower latency, significant mobile battery savings, more viable browser/light nodes. WebTransport makes it possible to run native browser-based peer-to-peer connections without extensions, which in turn will enable a “wallet as a node” model.

### **libp2p powering DA sampling across multiple modular stacks**

Celestia, Avail, EigenDA clients leverage on libp2p for sampling, blob propagation, and data retrieval.  
libp2p upgrades directly improve DA throughput and user experience of rollup block times.  
 

### **libp2p’s P2P Test & Interop Framework is now used across ecosystems**

libp2p’s test & interop suites are now used across: Ethereum client testing, Polkadot substrate networking validation.Filecoin proofs and retrieval markets. This prevents network forks and cross-client divergence. A full overhaul of transport interop testing now provides 200× faster test execution, significantly improving developer velocity across languages.

### **Browser-Based P2P Connectivity Through AutoTLS and Web-to-Web Relaying**

AutoTLS, native browser-to-browser connectivity, and improved circuit relaying now bring web applications directly into the broader libp2p network. This unlocks true browser-native Web3: frontends that can directly connect to sequencing networks, key-management networks like LIT, and DeFi dApps and exchanges — without centralized RPC or backend intermediaries.  
The AutoTLS client specification is also a strong example of collaborative progress across the ecosystem, with the Waku Foundation’s nim-libp2p team contributing directly through PR \#682 — a clear illustration of active community participation at the specification layer.

## 2025 R\&D HIGHLIGHTS

### **GossipSub scaling push (research → practice)**

nim-libp2p researchers are driving concrete GossipSub improvements, with coordinated cross-implementation work at libp2p Day @ DevConnect and new interop tests landing in the test-plans suite over the summer. These upgrades are already producing healthier, more predictable GossipSub behavior under high load, which directly strengthens block, attestation, and blob sidecar propagation across Ethereum L1/L2s and major rollups. They also reduce split-brain risks and cross-client regressions when teams upgrade, improving network safety. Celestia’s data availability layer benefits as well: lower latency and reduced bandwidth cost for DAS improve rollup block times and user experience. This research feeds into the next-generation Lean Consensus work, with the revived cpp-libp2p (Qvdrm leanp2p) and upcoming RLNC features pushing throughput ceilings even higher, setting the foundation for future Ethereum scaling.

### **P2P Network Monitoring**

ProbeLab’s network monitoring suite continues to benchmark and validate libp2p across seven major networks \[[link](https://probelab.io/)\]— Ethereum, Gnosis, Base, Celestia, Filecoin, Avail, Polkadot, and IPFS — with Optimism underway \[[link](https://probelab.io/optimism/dht/2025-34/)\]. This work provides real-time visibility into performance and reliability, allowing teams to detect issues early and prevent network forks or client divergence. The expanded interop matrix now covers Go, JS, Rust, Nim, Zig, Python, C, JVM, .NET, and eth-p2p-z (i.e. zig-libp2p), with new caching and targeted GossipSub interop tests. Transport interop improvements now run at a 200× speed increase while reducing code by 80%, dramatically improving developer velocity and test consistency \[[link](https://github.com/libp2p/test-plans/pull/727)\]. Together, these efforts ensure that libp2p implementations behave predictably across languages and ecosystems, strengthening the reliability of every network built on it.

### **Other networking transports**

libp2p supports and advances quic-go and webtransport-go, two foundational transport libraries used by thousands of projects. QUIC improvements deliver \~60% mobile battery savings, significantly improving the viability of light clients, mobile wallets, and Portal Network participation. Faster connection setup and reduced head-of-line blocking improve gossip propagation under congestion. WebTransport progress brings modern, secure browser-to-node   
connectivity and is already powering early-stage work in shared sequencing and cross-rollup messaging. These improvements bolster the networking foundations for modular L2/L3 ecosystems, helping ensure credibly neutral and high-performance rollup interoperability.

Libp2p is advancing peer-to-peer networking more broadly by supporting implementations of quic-go and webtransport-go and making them available to the world. These are direct dependencies for go-libp2p, but also used by many other projects:

* **Quic-go** is an optimized, production-ready implementation of the QUIC protocol with 11.4k dependents. From community benchmarking, QUIC brings \~60% battery savings in mobile contexts \- where better energy/perf means more viable light clients and wallets (Android/iOS), healthier Portal Network participation, and broader user-run nodes across web3 communities. Lower connection setup latency and head-of-line blocking avoidance also helps with timely gossip during congestion events.  
    
* **Webtransport-go** implements the WebTransport protocol (over HTTP/3, on top of quic-go) that currently tracks the IETF draft-02 spec;. It has 434 dependents, 119 known PkgGoDev importers, and a growing ecosystem (though is still under-funded). For the Optimism Superchain and other modular rollup ecosystems, libp2p’s advances in transport reliability (QUIC/WebTransport) and peer discovery directly strengthen cross-rollup communication and shared sequencing—helping ensure modular L2s and L3s remain credibly neutral and performant.

### **Decentralized AI & Federated Learning**

Libp2p’s role in decentralized AI moved from concept to implementation in 2025\. New Python-based examples demonstrated how libp2p can power federated learning, collaborative model training, and agent-to-agent coordination without relying on centralized parameter servers. These reference implementations serve both as research tools and as practical blueprints for privacy-preserving, resilient AI systems, aligning naturally with emerging needs in edge computing, on-device intelligence, and autonomous agents. Industry & Volunteer Contributions. A defining strength of libp2p in 2025 was the depth and quality of volunteer contributions from industry engineers. Engineers from Huddle01, NVIDIA, DDN (Data Direct Networks), Hypertensor, and Linux Foundation Edge contributed code, design reviews, performance testing, specifications, and real-world operational feedback.

These contributions improved transport efficiency, observability, browser and media-path networking, AI-adjacent workflows, and large-scale deployment resilience. The participation of engineers working on video infrastructure, high-performance computing, enterprise systems, and edge platforms reinforced libp2p’s position as a neutral, production-grade networking layer that meets the needs of both Web3-native and traditional infrastructure organizations. Beyond libp2p itself, the broader transport layer also strengthened. quic-go and webtransport-go, used by thousands of projects beyond the Web3 ecosystem, received critical performance, security, and standards-alignment improvements—benefiting the wider internet as much as decentralized systems.

## Implementations

### **go-libp2p**

### **3\. Quic-go Maintenance and Security 2025 (March–December)**

**Aim**: This grant supported the continuous development, maintenance and security of quic-go throughout much of 2025\. The scope of work included identifying and patching critical vulnerabilities, responding to user reports, implementing new features to match evolving IETF drafts (such as NAT traversal and WebTransport capabilities) in addition to migrating the project away from outdated testing dependencies. It also supported performance optimizations, security improvements and major refactors to make contributions easier for the wider community. By funding sustained engineering attention over many months, the grant aimed to keep quic-go moving in parallel with QUIC protocol implementations.

**Intended Impact**: quic-go serves as a central networking component for libp2p and many other projects across the Web3 space and beyond. The impact of this work is measured in improved security, stability, performance and interoperability. By committing new work to open source, including support for community-driven contributions, this grant ensured that quic-go remains both trustworthy and usable at scale.

**Meta-summary**: This proposal supported continuous, security-focused maintenance of quic-go, aiming to protect and extend a cornerstone dependency of libp2p and broader decentralized systems. It strengthened the resilience of critical networking infrastructure and provided improvements that benefit countless developers in the open-source ecosystem.

### **4\. Go & JS Libp2p Maintenance (March–June)**

**Aim**: This grant funded continued maintenance of go-libp2p and js-libp2p as well as stewardship of protocol specifications and related tooling over the spring of 2025\. The proposal sought to attract new contributors, grow the contributor community and carry out critical maintenance and security work. By structuring development around ongoing user requests, the team aimed to maintain high standards of accountability while ensuring that the needs of large stakeholders were considered, even though specific resource allocations (such as for GossipSub optimization) were not directly included.

**Intended Impact**: The anticipated outcome of this work was to keep the core libp2p libraries dependable while also improving breadth of contributions and strengthening the ecosystem’s community ties. The central impact was to carry forward the ongoing maintenance of core open-source networking protocols essential for Ethereum, IPFS and other decentralized networks.

**Meta-summary**: This grant maintained critical libp2p infrastructure in early 2025 while laying groundwork for a more diverse contributor base. Its impact lies in keeping widely deployed implementations secure and functional and in strengthening their foundations as public goods, despite risks of misaligned priorities.

### **5\. Go & JS Libp2p Maintenance (July–December \- *Terminated after 2 months*)**

**Aim**: This grant extended the work on maintenance and stewardship of go-libp2p and js-libp2p for the second half of 2025\. Alongside ongoing maintenance the aim was to continue pushing for modularity in libp2p such as deepen collaboration with the Ethereum Foundation around scaling work such as GossipSub, and deliberately cultivate high value contributors within the community. The grant also emphasized sustaining the current development team while opening decision making processes more openly such as by publishing user feedback and progress updates in public forums.

**Intended Impact**: The intended outcome was twofold: to maintain a steady and secure development cadence of core libp2p implementations while also growing the contributor community particularly with non-Shipyard contributors. 

**Meta-summary**: This grant focused on incremental but essential upkeep of libp2p’s core implementations during the latter months of 2025\. Its impact was to preserve stability and continuity, maintain institutional knowledge within the team and modestly broaden contributor participation thereby reinforcing libp2p’s role as a foundational open-source project.

**Update**: Due to misalignments in go-forward maintainership expectations, this grant was terminated after 2 months (July \+ August).

### **6\. QUIC Stream Resets with Partial Delivery (May-Aug)**

**Aim**: This grant supported the addition of a technical feature which is support for QUIC Stream Resets with Partial Delivery into quic-go. The work aimed to align quic-go with the most recent WebTransport draft thus strengthening feature completeness and compliance with modern standards. The project entailed implementation, integration testing and release of the feature in quic-go’s mainline codebase.

**Intended Impact**: By implementing this feature quic-go gained compatibility with cutting-edge protocol standards opening the door for applications built on WebTransport to leverage QUIC seamlessly. As a result, the change benefits both developers working directly with quic-go and entire ecosystems that depend on up-to-date open-source protocol implementations.

**Meta-summary**: This grant targeted a focused but important feature upgrade to quic-go, enabling compatibility with the latest WebTransport standard. Its impact serves the public good by keeping open-source protocol implementations at the frontier of internet standards, ensuring broad accessibility and innovation across Web3 and beyond.

## Developer Engagement and Growth

Libp2p continues to grow as one of the strongest open-source networking ecosystems. The project now sustains 300+ monthly contributors, making it one of the most active developer communities in decentralized infrastructure.

Across the ecosystem, 16+ maintainer organizations including the Ethereum Foundation, Parity, ChainSafe, Status, and PLDG support and steward the core implementations. The project has also expanded to 10 active implementations, spanning Go, Rust, JS/TS, Python, .NET, Zig, Nim, C++, and more, demonstrating deep language diversity and broad applicability. 

Libp2p also saw growing academic adoption in 2025\. Universities across South Asia began incorporating libp2p into curricula spanning engineering, management, and design disciplines, reflecting the technology’s relevance beyond purely technical audiences. Institutions such as Netaji Subhas University of Technology (NSUT) integrated libp2p into coursework and projects focused on distributed systems, decentralized applications, platform design, and emerging digital economies. These programs exposed students to real-world peer-to-peer networking primitives, open-source collaboration, and system-level thinking—preparing the next generation of engineers, product leaders, and designers to build resilient, decentralized infrastructure. This academic momentum complements libp2p’s open development model, ensuring that both research and teaching feed directly back into production systems.
